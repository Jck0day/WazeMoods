# WazeMoods (Compatible with LSPosed)

Unlock Waze moods without do the 160km (I just made this project for fun I was bored haha)

You need to use LSPosed (or Xposed) on Android to hook Waze

If the mood does not change the first time, just restart the app after you select it. I also observed that moods will be unlocked for your account when you choose it : you don't need to keep this module installed
